<h1> Webcomics: </h1>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://www.collectedcurios.com/sequentialart.php">This one</a> is the webcomic that got me into webcomics in general. </li>
	<li> <a href="http://questionablecontent.net/">Here<a/> is one that has a couple thousand pages... and is still updated five days a week! </li>
	<li> <a href="http://xkcd.com/">This<a/> one plays to my nerdy side. (lots of jokes about math and science) </li>
</ul>
<p> Well, that's all for now! </p>
