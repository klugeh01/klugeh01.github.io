<h1> My First Webpage </h1>

<p> Hello! This is a webpage. Webpages are fun! </p> <br>
<p> Anyway, my name is Ehren and I'm a student at Luther College. <br>
	I am a Computer Science major and I enjoy singing in choir here <br>
	at Luther, where choir is a hug part of what happens on Campus.
<p> Images are fun, I learned how to do alt-text! </p> <br>
